				<h2><strong>About the Artist:-</strong></h2>
				Born in Los Angeles, California, a fifth generation Californian. At an early age I knew that I was to become an artist. My father was a fine art painter, who also painted many cabaret’s and restaurants in San Franciso and los Angeles in the 30’s and 40’s. My Grandmother was a fine pen and ink artist. She attended the Kansas City School of Art. In 1957 I won a state wide full scholarship to Chouinards Art Institute in Los Angeles, California. With 50+ years experience in graphic design, cartoon illustration and the fine arts fields, I have a diversified artistic background. This has afforded me many honors, awards and interesting projects.<br>
				I enjoy working in many art disciplines and seeking new ideas and challenges. My work often starts with a spontaneous play of color and design. Once started, I let the design take it's form and let the painting lead me forward, not alway advancing in the original concept. I am always looking for new creative ideas.It's just what I have to do, I can't think of doing anything else. I love the creative process.<br><br><br>
