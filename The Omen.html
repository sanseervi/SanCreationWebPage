				<h2><strong>About the Artist:-</strong></h2>
				For me painting is a way to convey to others what my inner reality looks like. I guess, that is what most artists are trying to do. This is why my paintings are mostly abstract. I access this inner reality with my eyes closed in quiet and relaxed state or in lucid dreams, which I am blessed to have from time to time. In this personal reality light and colour form structures with astonishing size and grandeur generating emotions and strong desire to share the experience. Sharing however is not easy. It is like to listen to the most amazing music and then try to talk about it. I am not sure that I will ever be able to express these experiences in full, but every painting brings me a bit closer.<br><br><br>
				<h2><strong>About the Artwork:-</strong></h2>
				The Omen is the seventh painting in a collection named Dream landscapes. This collection is about places I access when I have a lucid dream. I am blessed to have lucid dreams from time to time and painting is a great way to share the experience. The colors in this other reality are much brighter and the vision is somehow panoramic, which is a bit difficult to interpret. And of course there is the ever present sense of mystery, stepping in as soon as I realize I am in a dream. This particular dream was about two rival towns receiving an omen from above. The darkened skies were somehow intimidating but the towns looked very bright and festive. The paintwork continues on the sides of the canvas (gallery wrap) so framing is possible but not necessary. The piece is ready to hang. As default this artwork is signed on the back but I can sign it on the front too if requested.<br><br><br>
