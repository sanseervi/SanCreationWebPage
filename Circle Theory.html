Two aspects of his career are seen on the one hand, an abstract work with geometric themes such as circles and spirals, on supports such as canvases or wood in which he mixes oil, glues and earth; The other side consists basically of collage in which they evolve towards a more figurative art composed of natural elements such as cardboard sheets, flowers that you introduce on the canvas and blend with oil, glue and even acrylic paint,<br>
				Together it is a modern and dynamic painting even in its execution, since it uses great variety of pictorial materials like airbrush, acrylic spray, pallets … resources that give relief and chromatic changes in the works, since depending on how it affects the Light on the stand changes color. This chromatic change gives the work something new and original that differentiates it and gives it a vital and dynamic character.<br><br>
